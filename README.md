Project Demo
The project includes a complete demo to showcase application functionalities, from user registration and login to booking, managing, and tracking appointments.

Features
Customers can create an account and log in, view available doctors, book an appointment by selecting a doctor and providing relevant details, view booking status, receive updates on appointment approval, and cancel or reschedule appointments.

Doctors register and get approval from the admin, manage and view all booked appointments, and approve or reject customer appointments.

The Admin monitors and manages all users and doctors, approves doctor registrations, enforces policies, maintains user data, and oversees the platform's operation.

**Technologies Used**
Frontend technologies include React.js, Axios, Material UI, Ant Design, and Bootstrap. Backend technologies include Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and JWT. The database used is MongoDB.

Project Setup
Frontend Setup
To set up the frontend, navigate to the frontend folder by running cd frontend, then install dependencies with npm install. To start the frontend server, use npm start. The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

**Backend Setup**
For the backend setup, navigate to the backend folder with cd backend, install the dependencies by running npm install, and start the backend server with npm start. The backend server will be accessible at http://localhost:8001.

**Database Setup**
Download and install MongoDB. Create a new database named doctor_appointment, and connect the backend to MongoDB by updating the MONGO_URI in the .env file.

Milestones
**Milestone 1: Project Setup and Configuration**
Begin by creating the project structure with separate folders for frontend and backend. Install essential libraries for each part. For the frontend, use React.js, Material UI, and Bootstrap, and for the backend, use Express, Mongoose, JWT, and Multer.

**Milestone 2: Backend Development**
Set up an Express server with routes for user authentication, booking, and doctor management. Define data models for users, doctors, and appointments. Implement user authentication using JWT, along with session handling. Admin and doctor functionalities are established for managing users and appointments.

**Milestone 3: Database Schema**
The database schema includes User, Appointment, Complaint, and Chat schemas. Users can include customers, doctors, and admins. Appointments are recorded with associated details and status. Complaints allow users to register feedback, and the Chat schema supports message exchanges related to appointments.

**Milestone 4: Frontend Development**
Set up the React application, organize reusable UI components, and design the overall layout. Define routes for each component and integrate API requests for dynamic data.

**Milestone 5: Project Implementation**
Upon completion of development, deploy the application and perform testing. Conduct user interface checks to ensure smooth navigation, verify feature functionality, and fix any bugs.
